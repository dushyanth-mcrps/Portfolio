    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul type="bullets">
        <li>All-purpose flour: 1 ½ cups (195g), spooned and leveled</li>
<li>Sugar: 2 tablespoons (25g)</li>
<li>Baking powder: 1 tablespoon (12g), aluminum-free</li>
<li>Salt: ½ teaspoon (3g), reduce to ¼ teaspoon if sensitive to salt</li>
<li>Milk: 1 ¼ cups (295ml), dairy or non-dairy</li>
<li>Egg: 1 large</li>
<li>Unsalted butter: 5 tablespoons (70g), melted and cooled slightly</li>
<li>Vanilla extract: 2 teaspoons (10ml), reduce if sensitive to vanilla</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Prepare the butter: Melt the butter and set it aside to cool slightly.</li>
<li>Combine dry ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
Combine wet ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Don't worry if the butter solidifies a little.</li>
<li>Mix the batter: Create a well in the center of your dry ingredients. Pour the milk mixture into the well and gently whisk until the flour is just incorporated. A few small lumps are perfectly normal. As the batter rests, you should see it begin to bubble. It will be thick, like cake batter. If it seems too thick, add a splash more milk to thin it out.</li>
<li>Preheat the skillet: Place a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. To check if it's ready, sprinkle a few drops of water on the surface. They should “dance” around and evaporate quickly.</li>
<li>Cook the pancakes: Brush the skillet with melted butter for crispy edges (you can skip this if using a good nonstick pan). Scoop the batter onto the skillet using a 1/4 cup measure or a large cookie scoop, then gently spread each pancake into a 4-inch circle.</li>
<li>Flip the pancakes: After 1 to 2 minutes, the edges will look dry, and bubbles will form and pop on the surface. Flip the pancakes and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes until they are lightly browned and cooked through. Enjoy your pancakes right away with warm syrup, more butter, and berries.</li>
